## The Foundation of Financial Success

Budgeting is the cornerstone of financial health. It's not about restrictionâ€”it's about making intentional choices with your money.

### The 50/30/20 Rule

A simple budgeting framework:
- **50%**: Needs (housing, food, utilities)
- **30%**: Wants (entertainment, dining out)
- **20%**: Savings and debt repayment

### Creating Your Budget

Use the 50/30/20 rule or create your own categories.
